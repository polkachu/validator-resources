# Introduction



This is an **unofficial** support site for Kusama/Polkadot validators. It is started as I take note in the Element Chat \(formerly Riot Chat\) rooms such as [Kusama Validator Lounge](https://matrix.to/#/#KusamaValidatorLounge:polkadot.builders) and [Polkadot Validator Lounge](https://matrix.to/#/#polkadotvalidatorlounge:web3.foundation). Members in these chat rooms are immensely helpful in helping me get started as a Kusama Validator, and I thought it is worthwhile to codify my learnings.

Kusama/Polkadot has a comprehensive [wiki site](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/getting-started) that covers pretty much everything, including many resources for Kusama/Polkadot validators. This support site is by no means an attempt to duplicate the effort of the official guide. This site is purely validator-focused, and will not cover general Kusama/Polkadot topics \(such as parachain, crowdloan, democracy, etc\) unless it has a direct link with validators. Needless to say, if anything on this site is in conflict with the official guide, please trust the official guide. Moreover, you can click on "Edit on Github" and submit a pull request to make this site better. This site is open-sourced with this [repo](https://github.com/polkachu/validator-resources) on GitHub.  

This site will try to differentiate itself from the official guide in the following ways:

1. It includes more fan-created unofficial resources such as YouTube tutorials, Medium blog posts, etc.
2. It is not a comprehensive guide. Rather, it intends to surface the most frequently requested content and most frequently asked questions that I have observed in the chatrooms. 
3. It cover some corner cases that might not be of interest to the general validator population \(thus not included in the official wiki\) but of interest to those more technically inclined.
